# Avoiding Computer Vision Syndrome
This app will remind you to take a break for every 20 minutes using Facial Landmarks[1] and Eye Aspect Ratio Calculation [2]. The 20 minutes interval is taken from 20-20-20 rule (20 minutes spent @screen -> look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds) [3]. Normally, a person will blink between 10-15 times per minutes with blink rate when looking at a screen will be less than normal [4].
